# Geodesy

Compose visually distinct spaces to frame content on the web, creating a "memory palace" effect where the visual pattern on a page can be a cue to where you last saw some piece of information.

Geodesy works as a static website builder, rendering small template files into HTML/CSS where all content is placed within a grid of harmonic proportions. (1:1, Golden Ratio, Silver Ratio, etc)

```
npm i @lookalive/geodesy

TODO: implement file watching for static builds
```
